1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?
6 hours

2. Describe the features you have implemented.
I tried to replicate the design as best as possible, but I didn't implement the sidebar on the right. I also implemented a quiz in which 
only one option can be selected per question. I also made the quiz so that it can only be submitted when all the quesionts are
answered. I also implemented a retry button that lets the user retry the quiz.

3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
The retry button wouldn't delete itself after it was dynamically created for the first time. I fixed this by 
querying for the button based on its class instead of its id (which mean I also changed the button's id into a class )

4. How much time do you think you can spend each week working for theDP Web Department?
6 hours or more if needed

5. (Optional) If there is anything you want to tell us, go ahead :)
Submitting the file took a lot longer than expected :/
